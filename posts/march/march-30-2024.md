# March 30, 2024

## What I Will Accomplish:

- Begin the LAEP ChatBot Project from scratch
  - Create a new React Project and begin a roadmap of a structured project that allows messaging from the user and an AI chatbot
  - Begin creating the chat components
- CodeWars Problems to Practice JS
  - Square Every Digit: "Square every digit of a number and concatenate them."
- Begin Static Blog Site Project
  - Create a Static Blog Site that I will finish today that will take markdown files and transition them into JSX code, so that the page does not need to fetch any data

## What I Accomplished:

- Started building the UI for LAEP ChatBot Project from scratch
  - RoadMap for the ChatBot UI will be to create the front-end first where messages will need to be neatly formatted on the screen
  - Created Components for the Chat Interface such as ChatContainer, ChatMessage, ChatUserInput
  - Styled the UI with Tailwind CSS to give a sharp and clean look
  - Tested thoroughly to make sure user input can be displayed on screen for small and large messages
  - Used automatic scrolling to go to the bottom of the page when the user sends a large message
- CodeWars Problems

  - Square Every Digit: For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9^2 is 81 and 1^2 is 1. (81-1-1-81)
    Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 7^2 is 49, 6^2 is 36, and 5^2 is 25. (49-36-25)
    Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.
  - Code:

    ```
    function squareDigits(num){
      const numString = num.toString();
      const numArr = numString.split("");
      let resList = [];

      numArr.forEach((char) => {
        const numInt = char - '0';
        resList.push(numInt * numInt);
      })
      console.log(resList);

      const resString = resList.join("") -'0';
      return resString;
    }
    // Make sure code is formatted neatly
    ```

  - Other coding problems here

## What I Learned:

- LAEP ChatBot Project
  - How to leverage useRef to manipulate DOM elements. This was useful in 2 areas in my project:
    1. textarea where the user types their message and the size automatically increases its height (textArea row attribute gets larger) and decreases back to its original size once the message is sent.
    2. Scrolling to the bottom of the last element in the message container (a container of individual messaging components) when a user submits a message.

## What I Need to Do Tomorrow:

- LAEP ChatBot Project: Begin the serverside logic for the chatbot to work with OpenAI, where the AI message is also listed
- 3 more Codewars Problems
- Last touches on the Static Blog website
